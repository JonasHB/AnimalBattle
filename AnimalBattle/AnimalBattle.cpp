// AnimalBattle.cpp
// Main file. The program AnimalBattle is a fantasy battle simulator. The purpose of the program
// is to serve as a porfolio showing a program created by JHB.

// Todo: Complete commenting the code
// Todo: Can I really use the class Bow as I've done? An inventory has a list of the class Weapon, not Bow. But it seems to work.
